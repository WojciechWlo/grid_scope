## 🚀 About
Grid Scope is a web application that allow user load data from any number of google spreadsheets, transform them using SQL scripts and then upload them into another google spreadsheet. Such ETL process is really simple. User just need to:
1. recover its Google Cloud Console key (which is considered the most difficult in entire process :) )
1. provide it in the **Keys form**
1. provide spreadsheet data in the **Spreadsheets form**
1. provide input ranges in the spreadsheets (specified in the previous step) in the **Inputs form**
1. provide output cell in the spreadsheets (specified in the previous step) in the **Outputs form**
1. define process by providing list of input ranges, providing SQL query transforming them and then choosing the output spreadsheets in the **Processes form**

All data (specifically the processes) are preserved and may be quickly executed just by clicking the button!

## ⚡ Getting Started

Go to project folder and for development mode run in console:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev up --build
```
For production mode run:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml --env-file .env.prod up --build
```

## 🗒️ Note

Remember to change any secrets from .env both after clonning repository and after creating containers!

Django Secret key Generate:
```
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print('django-insecure-' + get_random_secret_key())"
```

## ⏳ Future Work
This is not the end of the project. There is still a lot stuffs to add!
